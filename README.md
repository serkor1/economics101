### The Supply and Demand Model


#### Introduction

The `linear_function()` is defined as $$ p = -\alpha (1+\tau)x + 20 - \Gamma $$ for the `demand`-function, and $$p=\beta x$$ for the `supply`-function.


#### Parameters

Each parameter is directly controlled by the sliders in the following way:

1. Demand and Supply elasticity defines $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respecively
2. VAT controls the value of $\tau$ where $\tau \in ]0,1[$
3. Lump Sump controls the $\Gamma$

#### Shock Parameters

This application currently only supports shocking either `supply` or `demand` positively or negatively. Any shock will shift the desired curve by 5, or -5 for positive and negative shocks respectively.

#### Output

The application currently supports calculating the following,

1. Equilibrium Price
2. Equilibrium Quantity
3. Consumer Surplus
4. Producer Surplus
5. Total Welfare


#### Future Updates

1. Price Controls
2. Dead Weihgt Loss
3. Tax Revenue
